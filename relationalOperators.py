# Example of relational operators in Python

# Definition of two variables
a = 7
b = 3

# Equal to operator
if a == b:
    print(f"{a} is equal to {b}")
else:
    print(f"{a} is not equal to {b}")

# Not equal to operator
if a != b:
    print(f"{a} is not equal to {b}")
else:
    print(f"{a} is equal to {b}")

# Greater than operator
if a > b:
    print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
else:
    print(f"{a} is not greater than {b}")

# Less than operator
if a < b:
    print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
else:
    print(f"{a} is not less than {b}")

# Greater than or equal to operator
if a >= b:
    print(f"{a} is greater than or equal to {b}")
else:
    print(f"{a} is not greater than or equal to {b}")

# Less than or equal to operator
if a <= b:
    print(f"{a} is less than or equal to {b}")
else:
    print(f"{a} is not less than or equal to {b}")
